== Usage

=== Workflow

[source,yaml]
----
name: jbang

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  release:
    name: Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      # Configure build steps as you'd normally do

      - name: Setup JBang
        uses: jbangdev/setup-jbang@main
       
      - name: properties
        run: |
          jbang properties@jbangdev
        
----

IMPORTANT: This action will download a suitable Java runtime automatically if one is not available. Thus this action does not need a pre-configured Java setup. The action and JBang will though prefer to use a JDK if it is available. GitHub runners have a default Java 11 available thus it will use that Java by default. If you would like to use a different Java version/distribution, then add a `actions/setup-java` as needed. Example:

[source,yaml]
----
name: jbang

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  release:
    name: Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      # Configure build steps as you'd normally do

      - name: Setup Java
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          java-version: '20'
          
      - name: Setup JBang
        uses: jbangdev/setup-jbang@main
       
      - name: complexhelloworld
        run: |
          jbang properties@jbangdev java.version
